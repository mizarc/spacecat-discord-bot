# Contributing to SpaceCat

So you'd like to contribute to the SpaceCat Discord project? Well you're in luck because we're a little short on developers... or generally just anyone ranging from designers, testers, QA, translaters, you name it. If you've got any experience in Python or would just love to create a better Discord experience for everyone, feel free to join the club so long as you're willing to accept the few and loose guidelines.

## Want to talk?
There's no official method of communication right now, but you can join my testing Discord server for questions and contribution related conversations.

If you need any help with the Discord API itself, you're best going on the Discord API server.

## How Do I Contribute?

### Bug Reporting
The easiest way to contribute to the project without programming experience is to simply report bugs on the [issue page](https://gitlab.com/Mizarc/spacecat-discord-bot/-/issues). Be sure to follow the issue reporting guidelines, providing as much information as possible so as to reduce confusion and speed up the bug squashing process.

### Feature Requesting
As with bug reporting, you may report features on the [issue page](https://gitlab.com/Mizarc/spacecat-discord-bot/-/issues). Your requested features must be something that can be managable to implement in a reasonable amount of time, while also being something that people will regularly use. Please describe the necessary use cases and be as detailed as possible.

### Code Contribution
If you've had a look at the feature request or bug report page and want to contribute before I get the time to, you may fork the project and send a merge request to potentially have your changes added. If you're new to git, here's a general rundown:

1. Fork the repo from THIS project
2. Clone your forked project onto your own device
3. Work on changes on your copied repo as you see fit
4. Submit a pull request on THIS project

If you've become a regular contributer, you may end up on the development team to be able to contribute directly onto this project. :D

## Project Structure

### What do all the branches mean?
Branches are laid out in a pretty straightforward way.
- `master` holds the lastest development release. Ensure that it is able to be run at all costs. Do not commit to this directly.
- `feature/` prefix is for adding new or improving upon existing features.
- `fix/` prefix is for non urgent bugs or bugs that may take an extended time to repair.
- `hotfix/` prefix is for urgent bugs that should be worked on ASAP and sent to the next patch release.
- `release/` prefix is for maintaining an older feature release, usually to send out bug fixes.

### Why are the folders organised the way they are?
Somewhere along the line I decided this was a good way to organise a Python project. They're not very clear as to how to properly structure a project so I came up with my own style. If you want to dispute it and make some changes, contact me on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AzNake). I'm always willing to learn more.
- `assets` holds elements such as images, videos, audio, etc.
- `cache` is for temporary bot generated content. This is cleared on restarts.
- `data` is for persistent bot generated content. Try to change this as little as possible as data restructuring is a nightmare.
- `logs` contains log data generated by the discord api, useful for fixing bugs.
- `scripts` usually gets used for testing purposes, to fix problems externally from the bot.
- All necessary python source code is located within the `spacecat` folder
  - `helpers` is for code that is shared between modules.
  - `modules` are collections of commands and listeners, forming a complete feature set.

## Style Guidelines

### Git Messages
- Use an imperative, present tense style (Say "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
- Be descriptive, explain why the changes were made and what was implemented to do so.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Add a blank line between the subject line and the commit message body.
- Limit the message body to 72 characters per line.

### Python
This project generally just follows the PEP8 layout. Your IDE of choice should warn you if you're doing things outside of PEP8 boundaries, but you can also refer to [The official PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Most importantly:
- We use spaces, not tabs.
